# COMP 163 - Project 2: Character Abilities Showcase
# Arina Safrit - COMP 163 Sec 5
•	Bonus Creative Features: Did you add anything unique?
    I added weapons type that the character can either have or not have. The program assigns sword to warrior, staff to mage and a dagger to rogue. 
•	AI Usage: What AI assistance did you use and where?
    I used AI to help debug the code, and how to correct the errors when pytest was run.
•	How to Run: Clear instructions for testing your code
    All you have to do is run the program and the battle simulation will populate. It will display character name, class, stats and weapon type. It will also tell you who won the battle depending on the outcome of the simulation.
